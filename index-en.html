                    <p>Counselling is a chance to work with the way how we perceive the world and ourselves and transform it. This leads to increased self-confidence and happiness.</p>

            <h3 class="wide uppercase">Individual counselling</h3>
            <p>The most common form of therapy is individual counselling. It is a strictly confidential discussion between the client and the counsellor about issues that the client struggles with and which they together seek to understand.</p>
            <p>The usual frequency for counselling is once a week for 50 minutes. The overall duration of the therapy is individual and depends on the client’s needs.

                <p>
                Person Centred Approach (PCA) belongs to humanistic psychology. This approach was developed in the USA in middle of the 20th century by the psychotherapist Carl R. Rogers.</p>
                <p>In those days it was revolutionary because Rogers as the psychotherapist refused to play the expert with regard to the client’s life. Instead he tried to like and understand his client. Therefore the name ‘person-centred’.<span class="hightlight"> Rogers saw that clients are the best experts when it comes to their own lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p>The theory behind PCA, in brief, proposes that every living organism has a built-in programme of growth. In an ideal environment the organism develops both physically and mentally in an optimal way. If for any reason this programme is disturbed and the natural growth is stunted, it leads to disturbances.</p>
                <p>The goal of psychotherapy is to provide<span class="hightlight"> a physically and psychologically safe environment where clients can face their problems honestly,</span> without hiding behind a social facade.</p>
                <p>Rogers realised that if the psychotherapist is able to create an environment in which clients and their issues are unconditionally accepted, while at the same time staying empathic and authentic (the psychotherapist himself is not hiding behind a facade),<span class="hightlight"> the result is a spontaneous ‘correction’ of the programme.</span></p>

                    <h3 class="uppercase">How it works</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="two-thirds">
                    <p>So much for theory. In praxis it means that you bring your thoughts, fears, worries and feelings and whatever else burdens you to the session. We will talk. I will listen to you carefully. I will not judge, nor give labels, nor present you with a diagnosis. I will not give advice.</p>
                    <p> My goal is to instead empathically understand where you are coming from. If this is achieved,<span class="hightlight"> it will enable you to work through any unresolved issues and to regain trust in yourself and in life,</span> which corresponds to Roger’s and my experience. Confidentiality is guaranteed.

                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p class="smaller-text">I was born in 1983 and grew up in Bratislava, Slovakia. I later lived in Vienna, where I studied first Informatics and then Psychology. Now I live and work in Prague.</p>

                <div class="two-thirds">
                    <h3 class="top-b">Why I became a counsellor</h3>
                    <p> I experienced a hugely positive shift in my life thanks to counselling. Up until my early thirties I was quite successfully developing my IT career. Then I went through a life crisis because of a break up, which forced me to seek answers.</p>
                    <p> In the end it was counselling that transformed my perception of life. Thanks to it realised that life and the world are fine as they are. The beauty of this insight was that it was a real experience and not just mere words.</p>
                    <p>At this point I found my new calling. I started to study psychology and to train in the same kind of psychotherapy as I had benefited from: the person centred approach.</p>
                    <p> I left university after three semesters. I felt that more theory would not make a more empathic—and therefore better—counsellor. I then continued solely with my training, which I completed in 2019.</p>
                    <p><span class="hightlight">Counselling is practical and effective. It is transformative. It has radically changed my life for the better and I find it rewarding to work with people on regaining their trust in this miracle called life.</span></p>
