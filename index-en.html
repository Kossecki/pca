                    <p>
                        Therapy primarily helps to achieve a genuine understanding and acceptance of oneself. Unlike
                        temporary fixes, this process brings lasting positive results. It increases confidence and
                        happiness and empowers people to live fully, true to their own values.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If we both decide to work together, during therapy sessions we will talk about your thoughts,
                        fears, worries and feelings and whatever else burdens you. I will listen to you carefully. I
                        will not judge, nor give labels, nor give you a diagnosis. I will not give advice.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-3">
                        My goal is instead to empathically understand where you are coming from. When your openness is
                        met with empathy and acceptance, it will enable you to work through any unresolved issues and to
                        regain trust in yourself and in life. Confidentiality is guaranteed.
                    </p>

                            We think that we listen but rarely do we listen, with real understanding, true empathy. Yet
                            listening, of this very special kind, is one of them most potent forces for change I know.

                    <h3 class="lead light">Person Centered Approach</h3>
                    <p>
                        In therapy sessions with me you will experience the Person Centered Approach (PCA). This
                        approach belongs to humanistic psychology and was developed in the USA in the middle of the 20th
                        century by the psychotherapist Carl R. Rogers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In those days it was revolutionary because Rogers as the psychotherapist refused to play the
                        expert with regard to the client’s life. Instead he tried to like and understand his client,
                        therefore the name ‘person-centered’. Rogers saw that clients are the best experts when it comes
                        to their own lives.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The theory behind PCA, in brief, proposes that every living organism has a built-in programme of
                        growth. In an ideal environment the organism develops both physically and mentally in an optimal
                        way. If for any reason this programme is disturbed and the natural growth is stunted, it leads
                        to disturbances.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The goal of psychotherapy is to provide
                        <span class="highlight"
                            >a physically and psychologically safe environment where clients can face their problems
                            honestly,</span>
                        without hiding behind a social facade.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rogers realised that if the psychotherapist is able to create an environment in which clients
                        and their issues are unconditionally accepted, while at the same time staying empathic and
                        authentic (the psychotherapist himself is not hiding behind a facade),
                        <span class="highlight">the result is a spontaneous ‘correction’ of the programme.</span>

                        />

                        <p>
                            I was born in 1983 and grew up in Bratislava, Slovakia. I later lived in Vienna, where I
                            studied first Informatics and then Psychology. Now I live and work in Prague.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I experienced a hugely positive shift in my life thanks to therapy. Up until my early
                            thirties I was quite successfully developing my IT career. Then I went through a life crisis
                            because of a break-up, which forced me to seek answers. In the end it was therapy that
                            transformed my perception of life. Thanks to it I realised that life was fine as it was. The
                            beauty of this insight was that it was a real experience and not just mere words.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At this point I found my new calling. I started to study psychology and to train in the same
                            kind of psychotherapy as I had benefited from: the person centered approach.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I left university after three semesters. I felt that more theory would not make me a more
                            empathic—and therefore better—therapist. I then continued solely with my training, which I
                            finished in 2019.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="lead light">What I value about therapy</h3>
                        <p>
                            Therapy is both practical and transformative. It has radically changed my perception of life
                            for the better and I find it rewarding to work with people on regaining their trust in this
                            miracle called life.

                        I follow the Code of Practice of the Czech Association for Psychotherapy (ČAP) and have regular
                        supervisions.

                        If I am not directly picking up your phone call, chances are that I am in a therapy session with
                        a client. In that case please call again later or email me.
